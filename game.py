    '''
    Try taking a journey by covered
    wagon across 2000 miles of plains,
    rivers, and mountains. Try! On the
    plains, will you slosh your oxen
    through ud and watter-filled ruts
    or will you plod through dust six
    inches deep?

    How will you cross the rivers? If
    you have money, you might take a
    ferry (if there is a ferry). Or,
    you can ford the river and hope
    you and your wagon aren't swalled
    alive!

    What about supplies? Well, if you're
    low on food you can hunt. You might
    get a buffalo ... you might. And
    there are bear in the Mountains.

    At the Dalles, you can try navigating
    the Columbia River, but if running
    the rapids with a makeshift raft
    makes you queasy, better take the
    Barlow Road.

    If for some reason you don't
    survive -- your wagon burns, or
    thieves steal your oxen, or you
    run out of provisions, or you die
    of cholera -- don't give up! Try
    again... and again... until your
    name is up owith the others on
    The Oregon Top Ten.

    Creation of this product is the
    Hack University Python Foundations
